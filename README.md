# Guest-Host-Interaction-Optimization
Objective: To improve the acceptance rate of guests and hosts, training a Random Forest.

The project contains two sections: 
- Data treatment and model training, with the objective of understanding based on which criteria are guests are accepted, and suggest actions to take to improve the acceptance rate.
- An A/B testing to evaluate if it is appropriate to restrict the first interaction to a minimum of 300 characters.
